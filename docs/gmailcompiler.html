										<h2>My Problem</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I like many people suffer from an overly busy email. I stay on top of my inbox, but I found that individually reading
                                        each of my daily school related emails took up way more time than it should. I realized that these emails consistently
                                        came from the same sources (professors, departments, piazza, gradescope, etc.) or had similar items as their subjects
                                        (grades released, reading, information session, etc.). I knew there must be a way to compile these emails into a central
                                        location where I could read them all at once, visit or download any important linked resources that they shared.

												<h3>The Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I created a script that uses an interface to the Gmail API called ezgmail and other common libraries
                                                like datetime and tzlocal as well as dominate which is a very useful libary for creating and manipulating HTML documents.
                                                The script finds any emails that match a user's search parameters and writes a simple HTML webpage containing a short summary 
                                                of every email as well as any links each email contained.
                                                It also saves the webpage as well as any attachments from the emails to a specified directory on the user's computer and links 
                                                to those achments from the webpage. Once the user executes the program, they are given the option to mark all of the compiled
                                                emails as read. I have found that I usually use this feature because I most everything I need from the emails in the webpage already!
                                                If anyone else is interested in personalizing it for themselves and using it
                                                for their gmail, there is more info about how to use the script in the README of the Github respository. Check it out!
                                            </p>
